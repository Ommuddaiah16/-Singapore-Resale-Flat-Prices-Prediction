# Singapore Resale Flat Prices Prediction

This project aims to develop a machine learning model and deploy it as a web application to predict the resale prices of flats in Singapore. By analyzing historical data of resale transactions, the model assists potential buyers and sellers in estimating the market value of flats.

## Project Description

The Singapore resale flat market is competitive and dynamic, making it challenging to accurately estimate the resale prices of flats. This project addresses this challenge by leveraging machine learning techniques to predict flat prices based on various features such as location, flat type, floor area, and lease duration.

### Key Components:

- **Data Collection and Preprocessing**: Data is collected from the Singapore Housing and Development Board (HDB) and preprocessed to ensure quality and usability.
- **Feature Engineering**: Relevant features are extracted and engineered to enhance the model's predictive accuracy.
- **Model Development**: Several machine learning models are developed, trained, and evaluated to identify the best-performing model.
- **Web Application**: A user-friendly web application is created using Streamlit, enabling users to input flat details and obtain price predictions.
- **Deployment**: The application is deployed on the Render platform to make it accessible over the internet.

### Skills Demonstrated:

- Data Wrangling
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Machine Learning Model Building
- Web Application Development
- Model Deployment

### Benefits:

This project provides valuable insights to both potential buyers and sellers in the Singapore housing market. Buyers can estimate resale prices to make informed decisions, while sellers can understand their flat's potential market value. Additionally, the project showcases the practical application of machine learning in real estate and web development.
